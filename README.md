# nvim-newline-brackets
My first attempt at a neovim plugin. The goal is to put the paired bracket two lines down, and your cursor one line down, indented and ready to start typing. 

I recognize this functionality already exists in various plugins, and different keymappings found all over the place on the internet. That being said, using the plugins all contain more than I want, the mappings are elegant, or it's a series of vim motions that use my jump list. None of these are really what I want, so I decided to try my own hand at it. The additional goal here is to learn how to make a neovim plugin, learn the treesitter api, and get involved with the community. 

Thanks TJ for all the awesome nvim content
